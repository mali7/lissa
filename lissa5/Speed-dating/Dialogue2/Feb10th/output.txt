#5: SO WHAT IF MONEY WAS NOT AN ISSUE AND YOU COULD LIVE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHERE WOULD YOU GO? 
#6: AND WHAT WOULD YOUR DREAM HOME BE LIKE? 
#7: WHAT I LOVE ABOUT STORIES OF RICH PEOPLE HOMES IS THAT THEY ALWAYS HAVE SOME KIND OF CRAZY ROOM, A LEGO ROOM, OR A ROOM FOR THEIR HUNDREDS OF GUITARS. IT REALLY GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT THEY ARE INTO AND WHAT IS SPECIAL TO THEM. LIKE ME, I WOULD REALLY LOVE A ROOM FIELD WITH VIDEO GAME SYSTEMS. NOT JUST THE NEWEST ONES, BUT EVERY SINGLE VIDEO GAME SYSTEM SO I WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PLUGGING THINGS IN.

#11: TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU MISS ABOUT YOUR HOMETOWN? 
#12: WHAT DO YOU LIKE BETTER HERE? 
#13: DO YOU STAY IN TOUCH WITH ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS FROM HOME ? 
#14: SO WITH THIS WHOLE MAJOR THING, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS AFTER YOU GRADUATE? 
#15: AND WHAT IS YOUR DREAM JOB? 
#16: FOR ME, MY DREAM JOB WOULD BE AS A PROGRAMMER FOR SOME SMALL STARTUP COMPANY . I THINK IT WOULD BE ESPECIALLY FUN IF I COULD DO IT WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS I ALREADY KNOW FROM COLLEGE. I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH ARE ALSO PEOPLE YOU REALLY ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH. BUT MAYBE IT COULD BE ALSO BAD IF THE ONLY PEOPLE YOU HANG OUT WITH AFTER WORK ARE THE SAME GUYS THAT YOU GOT SICK OF DURING THE DAY. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WORK FRIENDS? 
#17: LISTEN, I THINK WE NEED TO FINISH FOR TODAY, BUT IT HAS BEEN GREAT KNOWING YOU! PLEAS CLICK ON THE STOP BOTTON TO END THIS CONVERSATION.
