#1: HI I AM LISSA . I AM AN AUTONOMOUS AVATAR AND MY BEHAVIOUR IS DRIVEN BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. I MAY SOUND CHOPPY, BUT I AM STILL ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU. I AM HERE TO HELP YOU PRACTICE TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF, SO WE WILL HAVE A CONVERSATION FOCUSED ON YOU. THIS WILL BE MORE HELPFUL, IF YOU GIVE LONGER ANSWERS. DURING THE CONVERSATION, THE SYSTEM WILL TRY ITS BEST TO PROMPT YOU ON YOUR EYE CONTACT, VOLUME, BODY MOVEMENTS, AND SMILING. IF THE EYE ICON FLASHES RED, IT MEANS YOU CAN TRY MAKING MORE EYE CONTACT. IF THE SMILEY FACE FLASHES RED, PERHAPS YOU COULD TRY SMILING MORE. IF THE SPEAKER ICON FLASHES RED, THEN PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR VOICE. YOU MIGHT NEED TO SPEAK UP OR YOU MIGHT NEED TO QUIET DOWN. IF THE SHAKING PERSON ICON FLASHES RED, THEN PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR BODY. CAN YOU BE MORE ANIMATED? IS YOUR POSTURE OKAY? AS YOU MAKE THESE ADJUSTMENTS, THE ICON WILL SWITCH BACK TO GREEN.
