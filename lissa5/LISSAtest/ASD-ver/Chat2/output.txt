#1: HELLO AGAIN , ITS NICE TO SEE YOU . V ARE GOING TO PICK UP OUR CONVERSATION WHERE WE LEFT OFF. WHILE WE TALK, THE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE GIVING YOU FEEDBACK IN THE SAME WAY IT GAVE YOU FEEDBACK BEFORE.
#2: SO I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT ROCHESTER BEFORE. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT CITY YOU'D WANT TO LIVE, WHEN YOU GROW UP?
#3: OH, THAT'S COOL.
#4: AND TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE KIND OF HOME YOU WOULD WANT LIVE IN.
#5: THAT IS REASONABLE! NICE APARTMENTS COULD BE FOUND EVERYWHERE .
#6: WHAT I LOVE ABOUT STORIES OF RICH PEOPLE HOMES IS THAT THEY ALWAYS HAVE SOME KIND OF CRAZY ROOM, A LEGO ROOM, OR A ROOM FOR THEIR HUNDREDS OF GUITARS. IT REALLY GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT THEY ARE INTO AND WHAT IS SPECIAL TO THEM. LIKE ME, I WOULD REALLY LOVE A ROOM FIELD WITH VIDEO GAME SYSTEMS. NOT JUST THE NEWEST ONES, BUT EVERY SINGLE VIDEO GAME SYSTEM SO I WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PLUGGING THINGS IN.
#7: WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR CRAZY ROOM WOULD BE?
#8: SO YOU ARE REALLY INTO CARS .
#9: LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR FREE TIME. DO YOU LIKE WATCHING TV AND MOVIES, OR ARE YOU MORE OF A BOOK READER?
#10: I THINK BOOKS ARE A GREAT WAY TO SPEND TIME , THOUGH FOR ME , IT IS SOMETIMES HARD TO CONCENTRATE ON THEM , SINCE I AM SO ANIMATED . BY THE WAY , I AM SURE ME HAVE SEEN SOME MOVIES , SO LET'S TALK ABOUT MOVIES .
#11: WHAT TYPE OF MOVIES DO YOU LIKE ?
#12: WELL, I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF ACTION MOVIES .
